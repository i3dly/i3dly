# About Me
I am a Full Stack Engineer, with hands-on experience in start-ups, serving various key roles in
software development.

Advanced expertise in TypeScript and Node.js development with React, Apollo + GraphQL.

Demonstrated skill in researching emerging technologies, identifying opportunities to streamline
existing processes and collaborating in a dynamic environment.

# Private Stack
Below is my current, preferred stack for personal projects.

I definitely recommend trying this combination out, as I believe it offers a great developer
experience when it comes to extensibility, maintainability and productivity.

# Additional Recommendations (interesting?)
### Sorted alphabetically
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter for JavaScript/TypeScript/GraphQL/MDX  
[![ESLint](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/eslint)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)
* [GraphQL-Codegen](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) - Generate typed code for the client, from your GraphQL schema

* [Mjml-React](https://github.com/wix-incubator/mjml-react) - Write visually consistent and responsive emails in React  
[![Mjml-React](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mjml-react)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mjml-react)
  * Note: **Be warned** that this library uses [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), which will require an additional build-step when building with storybook.
* [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/) / [React-Popper](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/) - Tooltip/popover positioning engine  
[![PopperJS](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@popperjs/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popperjs/core)
[![ReactPopper](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-popper)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-popper)
* [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Much easier forms and validation in React  
[![React-Hook-Form](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-hook-form)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)
* [React-Window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) - For rendering large lists and tabular data  
[![React-Window](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-window)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window)
* [Redux / Redux-Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/) - Global state management (if Apollo-Client is not enough)  
[![Redux](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)
[![Redux-Toolkit](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@reduxjs/toolkit)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit)
  * Note: I strongly **DO NOT** recommended if all managed state can be handled well-enough with `useReducer`, `useContext` and/or caching.
  * Note: Only recommended if application requires really complex state that cannot easily be simplified and benefits greatly from DevTools + time travel.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Online payments processing  
[![Stripe](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stripe)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe)
[![Stripe.js](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stripe/stripe-js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js)
[![React-Stripe.js](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stripe/react-stripe-js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module bundler  
[![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
* [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) -  Schema-builder for value/input validation  
[![Yup](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/yup)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
  * Note: **Be warned**, if used on the front-end, [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) will be added to the client bundle.
  * Note: Consider using [`dynamic`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import) or [`lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) when writing components using this.

# Misc
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Git client for Windows, Mac & Linux
* [React folder stucture](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure) - Some good ideas, but I don't fully follow
